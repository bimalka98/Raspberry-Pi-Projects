On some distributions (in particular Red Hat), you may get a better experience
by running vncserver-virtual in conjunction with the system Xorg server, rather
than the old version built-in to Xvnc. More desktop environments and
applications will likely be compatible. For more information on this alternative
implementation, please see: https://www.realvnc.com/doclink/kb-546

Running applications in /etc/vnc/xstartup

VNC Server catchphrase: "Quiet Herbert potato. Galileo bambino extreme."
             signature: 23-fc-62-9a-aa-ba-2c-8c

Log file is /home/pi/.vnc/rpibimalka98:2.log
New desktop is rpibimalka98:2 (192.168.x.xxx:x)

```

2. Now open VNC viewer and type the server's ip produced by the above last command! -> 192.168.x.xxx:x

3. Provide the login credentials when asked
- username: pi 
- password: YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE

4. That's it. You are in!
